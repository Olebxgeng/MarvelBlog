                <h1>KANG THE CONQUEROR</h1>
                <p>A menace throughout time, on a journey to become the ruler of the Universe.</p>
            </section>
            <section class="info">
                <p>With lofty ambitions to rule over time and space, Nathaniel Richards, AKA Kang the Conqueror, will alter any timeline, including his own. He travels through time to accomplish his goals, posing a grave threat to any reality he encounters.</p>

                <h2>Prime Kang</h2>
                <p>Nathaniel Richards was born in the alternate timeline Earth-6311, aka Other-Earth. In this reality, the Dark Ages never occurred and technology developed without interruption. 
                    Their timeline having diverged circa 300 AD, the people of Other-Earth made their first moon landing in 900 AD, which became the first year of their new calendar. 
                    After a peaceful era, during which a lunar colony was established, a Great War between the colony and Earth destroyed the moon and plunged Other-Earth back into a primitive state. 
                    Nathaniel Richards of Earth-616, attempting time travel, reached Other-Earth and settled there; he used his knowledge to help rebuild that world and married Cassandra, daughter of the Matriarch of the Eyriennes. 
                    He became known as both the Warlord (erroneously) and the Benefactor.</p>
                <p>Approximately 1900 years later, in the calendar year 3000, Nathaniel Richards’ descendant and namesake was born into an age of peace and enlightenment thanks to his ancestor’s efforts. 
                    At age 16, the young robotics student Nathaniel develops a working Growing Man stimuloid model. However, his throat is slit by a bully, Morgan, causing him to spend the next year hospitalized. 
                    While recovering, he studies cross-dimensional recordings of the heroic age of Earth-616, brought to his reality by the Benefactor. 
                    At age 25, Nathaniel discovers the Benefactor’s citadel, his former fortress, and a long-sealed chamber, which contains part of a time machine, and plans for its operation.</p>   

                <h2>Enemies Across Time</h2>
                <p>Kang is his own worst enemy, constantly trying to prevent the future or undo the past. By doing so, he inadvertently creates variants of himself who sometimes hinder his world-conquering goals. Such variants include Immortus, Rama-Tut, Iron Lad, Victor Timely, Baby Kang, and the Council of Kangs.</p>
                <p>Kang forms the Council of Kangs to rid the universe of his redundant variant selves. He eventually faces the Council of Cross-Time Kangs, a group of aliens, creatures, and humans who take on his appearance and defeat robots used by Kang intended to help him rule several realities at once.</p>
                <p>In his travels through time, he becomes a time-misplaced menace to the Avengers, the Fantastic Four, and other heroic teams. He will occasionally team-up with Earth’s Mightiest Heroes when the time calls for it.</p>
