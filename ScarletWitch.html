                <h1>The Comics History of Scarlet Witch and Magneto</h1>
                <p>Scarlet Witch first met Magneto when he saved her and her twin brother Pietro, AKA the super-speedster Quicksilver, from a mob of superstitious villagers who believed that Wanda a witch. 
                    From this time onward, Magneto often guilted both Wanda and Pietro into repaying him by serving in his Brotherhood of Evil Mutants—a group determined to fulfill Magneto’s desire to conquer humanity with their superior mutant abilities. 
                    But at the time of their membership, neither Wanda nor Pietro were aware of their full ties to Magneto... 
                    That reveal came much later, in one of the twins’ earliest origins arcs, before Magneto’s official declaration of paternity in VISION AND THE SCARLET WITCH (1982) #4.</p>

                <h2>LEAVING THE BROTHERHOOD</h2>
                <p>After Magneto locked Quicksilver up for refusing to kill, he used fear tactics to scare Wanda into helping him fight his war against humanity. 
                    Wanda doubted him and thought the X-Men may be on to something, that there didn’t need to be a war at all. 
                    Magneto attempted to jail her too for this disagreement, but she fought back in fine mystic form and escaped with Pietro, off to join the Avengers, who more closely aligned with their values as seen in AVENGERS (1963) #16.</p>
                
                <h2>NOT REALLY FATHER OF THE YEAR</h2>
                <p>For Wanda and her brother, leaving the Brotherhood created a sworn enemy out of the Master of Magnetism. 
                    When Magneto came for them in the Inhuman city of Attilan, Wanda and Pietro fought back without a second thought. 
                    Wanda had just become an aunt to Pietro and Crystal’s human daughter Luna, and while Wanda protected the baby from the brawl, Magneto revealed that he would never hurt his granddaughter, shocking Wanda and Pietro with such a claim. 
                    See how he explains why he was an absentee father in VISION AND THE SCARLET WITCH (1982) #4, and how he is their dad in the first place!</p>
