                <h3>Riri Williams</h3>
                <p>Teenage super genius Riri Williams has taken Tony Stark's armor and reverse engineered it, adding her own modifications, and becoming a hero in her own right!</p>
            </section>
            <section class="info">
                <h2>Girl Genius</h2>
                <p>Riri Williams grows up with her mother and stepfather in Chicago, Illinois after the death of her father, Demetrius, her namesake. 
                    At the age of five, a series of tests show that she possesses a super-genius level of intelligence. 
                    As Riri grows, she pursues her passion for technology obsessively, choosing to spend time alone inventing new and advanced machines rather than making friends, playing with toys, watching TV, or even eating regular meals.</p>

                <p>As a little girl, Riri and her soon-to-be stepfather face an imminent threat during a Skrull invasion of Earth but are rescued by billionaire scientist, businessman, and Super Hero Iron Man.</p>
                
                <p>At the age of ten, Riri meets Natalie Washington, who becomes her best friend. 
                    A short time later, Riri embarks on a college career at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (M.I.T.). 
                    During this time, she contacts NASA, hoping to apply for the astronaut’s training program. Her age and lack of a college degree disqualifies her for the time being, but Riri’s desire to follow in the footsteps of her personal hero, the first African-American woman astronaut, keeps her going. Several years later, for Riri’s thirteenth birthday, Natalie arranges for the astronaut to call Riri on the phone and chat with her. 
                    But later that year, at a picnic in a park in Chicago, tragedy strikes. 
                    A drive-by shooting takes the life of Natalie and Riri’s stepfather, who are both shot in the heart and killed, a life-changing event that affects Riri deeply.</p>   
                
                <p>Fascinated by Iron Man, Riri builds herself a suit of armor, reverse-engineering Stark’s Mark-41 design and putting her own spin on it. 
                    Riri uses materials that she steals from around campus, including the robotics lab—and when a security team arrives at her dorm room to confront her about it, Riri puts on the armor and flies off, deciding to quit school.</p>
                
                <h2>A Hero’s Destiny</h2>
                <p>Riri soon became famous as Ironheart for her successful defeats of the Techno Golem and Biohack Ninja while she was working with Pepper Potts in her Rescue armor. 
                    Tony’s mother Amanda Armstrong then offered Riri Tony’s old lab and soon afterward, Riri was invited by both M.I.T. to return to the school and the Champions to join their team of teenage heroes.</p>

                <p>When the fascist Captain America, created by the Cosmic Cube named Kobik, usurped the American government with Hydra, Riri, equipped with the Tony Stark A.I., joined the Underground, a group of heroes to fight back. 
                    During this time, she worked under Black Widow and got to know the Champions a bit more. Separately, Riri soon faced Lucia von Bardas, a Latverian dictator terrorist who attacked American soil. S.H.I.E.L.D. encouraged Riri to go after her and things got out of hand. Meanwhile, a plan formed to take out the evil Captain America, but Black Widow lost her life to the villain. 
                    Ironheart and the Champions were arrested but later freed by the Underground when they defeated evil Cap and Hyrda.</p>

                <p>When Steve Rogers, AKA Captain America, returned, Kobik transported some of the heroes across time, with Ironheart landing in the future. 
                    While there, she met the Sorcerer Supreme version of Tony Stark, who, like the Stark from her time, inspired her.</p>
