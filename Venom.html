                <h1>VENOM</h1>
            </section>
            <section class="info">
                <p> A hulking and twisted distortion of Spider-Man, Venom is the result of an alien symbiote merged with a human holding a bitter grudge against Peter Parker. 
                    This combination has proven nearly lethal to the wall-crawler numerous times.</p>
                
                <P>Despite his hatred of Spider-Man, Venom has a twisted sense of morality, avoiding harming anyone he deems to be innocent and even performing heroic deeds. 
                    However, it is never clear how long Venom's darker impulses can be held in check. 
                    No matter how hard anyone tries to keep the symbiote down, Venom always manages to come back, like a plague.</P>

                <h2>Race of Symbiotes</h2>
                <p>Venom's origins can be traced to a race of symbiotes from the planet Klyntar. 
                    These beings merge with hosts, and the combined entity tends to have a personality based on both the symbiote and the host itself, though sometimes one side or the other tends to dominate.</p>

                <p>One particular symbiote found itself accidentally part of the scenery of Battleworld, a pieced-together, alien world created by the Beyonder to test heroes and villains against one another, including Peter Parker, AKA Spider-Man. 
                    After a pitched battle, Spider-Man's costume was ripped to shreds, and his ally Thor mentioned a device that restored fabric.</p>   

                <h2>Lethal Protector</h2>
                <p>Venom's twisted hate of Spider-Man, and his brief time as Spider-Man's costume, has led to his powers continuing to mimic Spider-Man's. 
                    Venom has a warning sense due to its alien origin and can swing from building to building in a similar manner as Spider-Man, using "webs" generated from the symbiote. 
                    The symbiote can change its outer appearance at will. His physiology masks him from Spider-Man's own Spider Sense. 
                    Venom is also extremely strong and agile, contributing to its ability to go toe-to-toe with Spider-Man.</p>
                
                <h2>A Venomous History</h2>
                <p>When Venom first bonded to Eddie Brock, it gave him specific knowledge gained when the symbiote was with Spider-Man. 
                    Eddie suddenly knew Peter Parker was Spider-Man, as well as the names of everyone close to Peter, such as Peter's then-wife, Mary-Jane Watson. 
                    Naturally, he used this information against Peter, first stalking him and then going after Peter's loved ones. 
                    Eventually, Spider-Man and Venom had their first real confrontation, and Spider-Man barely won thanks to sonic technology.</p>
